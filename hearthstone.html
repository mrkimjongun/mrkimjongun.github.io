											<p>
												Mage. Now that it’s finally neither the most popular, nor top-ranked class . . . nothing changes.  Most hated class since 2013. Meta (Rank 2/3):   While Rogue may top out at a higher rank than Mage in this meta, Mage is still one of the top classes.  The very design of such a flexible hero power means that the Mage can at any point in the game push for lethal, gain incremental card advantage, or situationally cause huge tempo swings on the board.  There is no downside here, and the flexible hero power ensures that Mage will not be falling out of the top any time soon.  Mage also has a nice balance of all types of class cards for the Arena game, fitting any archetype your deck trends toward.  Remember, Priest and Warlock aside, the Mage has the highest card advantage hero power, and Hunter aside, also the highest lethal dealing hero power.  The key to playing a Mage is to be able to shift your long-term game strategy to adjust to your opponent’s deck.  Like the Rogue, you have options, and you are one of the very few classes that plays almost as well without the board as with it.  As the game grows, and more and more types of win conditions pop up, this flexibility gets more and more important as you are more frequently put into positions where you must shift your game-plan mid-game to account for your opponent’s strategies.  The old days of mana+2 max tempo shifts of Classic are gone, and Mage is better suited than any other classes to this adjustment.
											</p>
											<p>Strength:  Answers.  The Mage has the largest variety of answers to any situation she may be confronted with.  Whether it be small removals, large removals, board clears, pings, or even freezing a weapon, the Mage has answers for everything.  Your job is to use your answers only as liberally as you have spares, and you should be able to overcome most problematic swing turns your opponent throws at you.   More than any other class, you will end up with the removals you need to avoid disastrous turns.  Remember, Priest matchup aside, you can always spend multiple turns to ping down a problematic minion, and frozen minions can usually be removed the next turn as easily as this one.  Getting good value out of your removals and not getting baited too hard into using them inefficiently is key to the Mage’s success.
												
											</p>
											<p>
												Weaknesses:  The Mage has no general weaknesses.  Playing as the Mage generally only requires responding to your opponent, which is easier than anticipating your opponent’s response, and you can play in a fairly carefree manner.  The story is flipped when you’re on the other side.  Against a Mage, you don’t have to worry much about her healing (Ice Barrier is not the most commonly seen secret), so aggressive strategies and Hunters do quite well against Mages, but that’s about all you can rely on.  Mage’s flexibility in terms of speed and gameplan means you’re generally at their mercy in terms of long-term gameplay unless you are extremely fast.  The best way to play against a Mage is to limit the effectiveness of her hero power by making trades that leave your minion with one health on turns where the Mage would lose too much tempo to use the hero power (typically, turns 3/5; but other turns as well if you get a read on their hand and lack of certain mana drops), limit the power of Flamestrike by putting out awkward boards if you’re ahead, and generally force the Mage into even value trades while knowing your deck is significantly heavier.  If your deck is not significantly heavier, you’ll be better suited trying to go faster.
